# 2-Wheeler-Anti-Theft

# About the project

A system that provides additional security measures, as well as alerts for attempt to theft for a new Moped or an already pre-owned one. It consists of an app that will have a login for the owner as well as for every user. This app will to communicate with the bike via Wifi module installed on the bike. The system then transmits the request to the server for authentication, where, if it is the owner, or any of the users added to the database are attempting to use the moped, they’re granted access. If someone else is trying to start the vehicle using the key, then the owner is notified of the event. If the owner is aware of another unregistered user using the bike, he/she can grant access to the user for a particular amount of time. If the access is denied, the bike won’t start. Additional security features include GPS live location tracking via the app, sensors that can alert the user in case the vehicle is being lifted or if the vehicle is being dragged for more than a set distance.
